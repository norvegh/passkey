PASSKEY
=======

Passkey is a password manager and password automation tool for Linux.

You can configure hotkeys for your passwords. Whenever you activate the hotkeys
the password will be sent to the active X window.
The password data file can be encrypted with the AES-128 cypher and protected
by a password.

MANUAL
======

Passkey is started on the CLI and runs as a daemon in the background.
There is no GUI, you can use the tool with specific command line options
to edit the password entries. If your data file in not encrypted
you can also edit it manually.

Without any arguments passkey will run as a daemon in the background and listen
for hotkey events. You can also use the following arguments:
 * -l   : list the currently configured triggers and their description
 * -a   : add a new entry (interactive mode)
 * -d   : delete an entry (interactive mode)
 * -s   : stop the daemon
 * --encrypt   : set or reset the master password and encrypt the data file
 * --decrypt   : decrypt the data file

For adding or deleting entries you dont have to specify any further options,
you will be prompted to enter the necessary information.
When you modify the password data via the tool the daemon is automatically reloaded
if running.

A password data entry has three parts:
 * trigger key
 * description
 * the password itself

The description and password fields are arbitrary text. The password can contain only
standard ASCII characters. The trigger is a single key with potential modifiers.
Multiple modifiers can be used together. The modifiers are the following:
 * CTRL
 * SHIFT
 * ALT
 * WIN

Some trigger examples:
 * WIN+Y
 * CTRL+ALT+R

The data is stored in ~/.passkey. In the unencrypted form it looks like this:

trigger1
description1
password1

trigger2
description2
password2

...
